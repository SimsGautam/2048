      <p>Hi! My name is Simanta Gautam, and I am currently a freshman at MIT planning to double major in Math and EECS with a minor in Philosophy. I’m a fan of 2048, so I thought this would be a cool way to share my interests and some of my previous projects! As you merge identical tiles, you will get new tiles that reveal an interest or a previous project of mine.

      <h3>MIT 6.470 Web Development</h3>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="3">During the Independent Activities Period (IAP) at MIT, students have the month of January to work on any project that they want. I used this time to get my feet wet in web development by creating a database-backed website with dynamically generated pages. Working in a team with three other students, we decided to make a website that helps local musicians connect with local fans as an event-finding and social network application.</font></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="3">My role in the team involved backend development with Ruby on Rails and some front-end design. From this project, I gained proficiency in HTML, CSS, Ruby on Rails, and some exposure to Javascript. Additionally, our website, <a href="http://metronotes.herokuapp.com/">Metronotes</a>, was awarded second place among 40 teams at the MIT 6.470 Web Development competition for functionality, aesthetics, and viability.</font><br> </p>

          <h3>Custom Built Automous Sailboat</h3>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="3">My ‘senior project’ in high school was an ambitious, 6-month undertaking to build a <strong>fully autonomous, 1-meter sailboat from scratch </strong>with four other students. In these six months, we acquired several thousand dollars in funding from local companies, designed and <strong>3D-printed</strong> some parts of the boat, and built a control system around an <strong>Arduino 2560 microcontroller</strong> using an integrated GPS and wind sensors. Lastly, we programmed a <strong>waypoint navigation algorithm</strong> that gave our sailboat the autonomy to sail by herself. </font></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="3">My role in the project was developing the waypoint navigation algorithm in <strong>C</strong>, contributing to the hull design on <strong>Autodesk</strong>, and communicating with dozens of tech companies to fund our project. From this project, I also gained a lot of experience in team collaboration and figuring out quick fixes to small problems that popped up throughout the project.</font></p>
 
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="3">In June of 2013, we went to Gloucester, MA to compete in the <strong>International Robotic Sailing Regatta.</strong> There, we were awarded first place in North America in the one-meter class after our team won all the autonomous events and the Innovation award for her six segment 3D-printed hull.</font></p>

<h3>Spherical Codes Problem</h3>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="3">I spent the summer after my junior year at doing research with the <strong>MIT Math Department</strong> as a participant in the <a href="https://math.mit.edu/news/summer/rsi.html">Research Science Institute</a>. Under the mentorship of a graduate student, I started my research on the Spherical Codes Problem, an open problem in <strong>discrete geometry and optimization</strong>, that summer.</font> </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="3">
        After the summer ended, I continued working on this problem in between classes during the school year. By the end, I created a <strong>gradient descent algorithm </strong>to optimally distribute points in higher dimensional spheres. This algorithm utilized concepts from <strong> group theory </strong>and produced some novel results for the problem. 
      </font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="3">
        I received several accolades for this project, including <strong>Second Place in Mathematics</strong> at the 2013 Intel International Science and Engineering Fair, Third Place <strong>Karl Menger Memorial Award</strong> by the American Mathematical Society, and <strong>"Best of Show"</strong> at the 2013 National Junior Science and Humanities Symposium.

      <h3>Bitcoin Research</h3>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="3"> 
        To keep myself busy during my sophomore year of high school, I started looking into <strong> Bitcoin</strong>, which, at the time, was only one year old and not very well known. I spent several months with a friend understanding Bitcoins in great detail and focused on <strong>documenting its vulerabilities</strong>. Eventually, we wrote a 36-page paper titled "On the Vulnerability of the Bitcoin Distributed Electronic Cash System".</font><p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="3"> One thing we focused on in this paper was the <strong>feasibility of a 51% attack</strong>, where the attacker amasses more CPU power than the rest of the network. We mined data from Bitcoin IRC Bot and estimated that, at the time, an attacker could amass more CPU power than the network for $136,000 per hour. This estimate was calculated assuming the attacker uses <strong>Amazon's Cluster GPU Instances</strong>.</font></p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="3">We chose not to publicly distribute our research, but email me if you're interested in reading the paper. Most of the statistics in the paper are now outdated.</font><br><br></p>

      <h3>Primitive Root Densities</h3>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="3">The summer after my freshman year in high school, I went to Boston University to study <strong>number theory</strong> at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_in_Mathematics_for_Young_Scientists">PROMYS</a>. After coming back from this program, I decided to independently pursue an open-ended problem in number theory regarding <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FullReptendPrime.html">full-reptend primes</a>. I extensively studied the <strong>densities and distributions</strong> of these primes in different bases.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="3"> 
        After several months of exploring and thinking, I came up with several conjectures of my own and proved them rigorously. I presented my work at the 2011 <a href="https://student.societyforscience.org/intel-isef">Intel ISEF</a>, where I received <strong>Second Place Grand Award </strong>in Mathematics and recognition from MIT Lincoln Lab by having a <a href="http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=28488">minor planet</a> named after me.

          <h3>Interest: Android Development</h3>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="3"> One of my current interests is in Android Development. I plan to finish going through the Android Development <a href="http://developer.android.com/training/index.html">tutorials</a> by the end of April. Along with the tutorials, I am also currently <strong>developing a note-taking app</strong> similar to Notes on the App Store, but meant to be more user friendly and with additional features like color tags. </font></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="3"> Eventually, I also hope to be able to <strong>develop simple games</strong> and integrate an app with physical machines as a form of <strong>remote control</strong>.</font></p>

        <h3>Interest: Micro Air Vehicles</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="3"> I'm really interested in Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs), especially <strong>quadcopters</strong>. One particular area that I find interesting in quadcopter development is creating fully <strong>autonomous</strong> copters in both GPS and <strong>GPS-denied</strong> areas.The latter case is much harder because stability is a key concern in development. A quadcopter must always be moving even when it's learning about its environment. </font></p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="3"> Recently, I joined the MIT UAV Team, and hope to gain experience with developing quadcopters. Eventually, I would like to be able to create a quadcopter that is integrated with a smart phone or one that does something useful. </font></p>

      <div id="machinelearning">
        <h3>Interest: Machine Learning</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="3">Though I don't know very much about this field, I have recently gained a lot of interest in machine learning. My interest mostly stems from the large range of applications of machine learning in technologies today and those to come. Other than Bayesian Networks, I haven't done any projects with machine learning, but I've worked on many projects where machine learning would have helped tremendously.</font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="3">This summer, I plan to either learn some topics in machine learning from textbook or work on some project that forces me to explore this field.</font></p>

      <div id="philosophy">
        <h3>Interest: Philosophy</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="3">
          Since coming to MIT, I have found that I really enjoy writing on philosophical topics. Though I've only taken courses like Survey of Philosophy and Bioethics, I've found time to read outside of class in topics like metaphyics and religion.</font></p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="3">
          Currently, I'm writing a paper titled "Religion in Us All", related not to religion in its most common definition, but to the values and ideas specific to an individual. Writing this particular paper is mostly an attempt to crystallize some thoughts I've had for a while.</font></p>
